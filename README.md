Here's hoping this class will help me in my college endevores, but I do not doubt that it will. Some people find it strange that I cannot play most physical games, but I learn best through machine. If I cannot go inside and look at the code for a program, I cannot truly enjoy it. Even then, I can get picky about what I get into. I spend my free time either coding a game or playing others, either for reference or for fun.
